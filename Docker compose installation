Install Compose on Linux systems

On Linux, you can download the Docker Compose binary from the Compose repository release page on GitHub. 
Follow the instructions from the link, which involve running the curl command in your terminal to download the binaries. 
These step-by-step instructions are also included below.

Run this command to download the current stable release of Docker Compose:

    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

To install a different version of Compose, substitute 1.25.4 with the version of Compose you want to use.

Apply executable permissions to the binary:

    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Note: If the command docker-compose fails after installation, check your path. You can also create a symbolic link to /usr/bin or 
any other directory in your path.

For example:

   sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose

Optionally, install command completion for the bash and zsh shell.

Test the installation.

    $ docker-compose --version
    docker-compose version 1.25.4, build 1110ad01
